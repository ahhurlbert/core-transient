# ---- EXPLORE AND FORMAT SPECIES DATA ----
#===============================================================================*
# Look at the individual species present:

levels(dataset5$species) 

# The first thing that I notice is that there are lower and upper case entries. Because R is case-sensitive, this will be coded as separate species. Modify this prior to continuing:

dataset5$species = factor(toupper(dataset5$species))

# Now explore the listed species themselves, again. A good trick here to finding problematic entries is to shrink the console below horizontally so that species names will appear in a single column.  This way you can more easily scan the species names (listed alphabetically) and identify potential misspellings, extra characters or blank space, or other issues.

levels(dataset5$species)

# If species names are coded (not scientific names) go back to study's metadata to learn what species should and shouldn't be in the data. 

# In this example, a quick look at the metadata is not informative, unfortunately. Because of this, you should really stop here and post an issue on GitHub. With some more thorough digging, however, I've found the names represent "Kartez codes". Several species can be removed (double-checked with USDA plant codes at plants.usda.gov and another Sevilleta study (dataset 254) that provides species names for some codes). Some codes were identified with this pdf from White Sands: https://nhnm.unm.edu/sites/default/files/nonsensitive/publications/nhnm/U00MUL02NMUS.pdf

bad_sp = c('')

dataset6 = dataset5[!dataset5$species %in% bad_sp,]

# It may be useful to count the number of times each name occurs, as misspellings or typos will likely
# only show up one time.

table(dataset6$species)

# If you find any potential typos, try to confirm that the "mispelling" isn't actually a valid name.
# If not, then go ahead and replace all instances like this:

# typo_name = ''
# good_name = ''

# dataset6$species[dataset6$species == typo_name] = good_name


# Reset the factor levels:

dataset6$species = factor(dataset6$species)

# Let's look at how the removal of bad species and altered the length of the dataset:

nrow(dataset5)

nrow(dataset6)

# Look at the head of the dataset to ensure everything is correct:

# !GIT-ADD-COMMIT-PUSH AND DESCRIBE HOW THE SPECIES DATA WERE MODIFIED!

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
# ---- MAKE DATA FRAME OF COUNT BY SITES, SPECIES, AND YEAR ----
#===============================================================================*
# Now we will make the final formatted dataset, add a datasetID field, check for errors, and remove records that cant be used for our purposes.

# First, lets add the datasetID:

dataset6$datasetID = datasetID

# Now make the compiled dataframe:

# !GIT-ADD-COMMIT-PUSH THE FORMATTED DATASET IN THE DATA FILE, THEN GIT-ADD-COMMIT-PUSH THE UPDATED DATA FOLDER!

# adequate number of years of sampling and species richness. If there are no 
# adequate years, the function will return a custom error message and you can
# try resetting sGrain above to something coarser. Keep trying until this

# at least 'topFractionSites' of sites met (with a default of 50%). We would 
# discard "poorly subsampled" sites (based on this criterion) from further analysis.
