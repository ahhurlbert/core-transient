#  -- If sampling is nested (e.g., site, block, treatment, plot, quad as in this study), use each of the identifying fields and separate each field with an underscore. For nested samples be sure the order of concatenated columns goes from coarser to finer scales (e.g. "km_m_cm")

# -- If sites are listed as lats and longs, use the finest available grain and separate lat and long fields with an underscore.

# -- If the site definition is clear, make a new site column as necessary.

# -- If the dataset is for just a single site, and there is no site column, then add one.

# Experimental Design There are 2 study sites, the Five Points grassland site, and the Rio Salado creosotebush site. Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals. Each block of plots is 96 meters on each side. Each block of plots consists of 4 experimental study plots, each occupying 1/4 of each block. The blocks of study plots are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system, with the top to the north. Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C), one plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits (Treatment: R), and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits (Treatment: L). The three treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently, and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the three plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters. Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters. A grid of 36 sampling points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points.

# Here, we will concatenate all of the potential fields that describe the site 
# in hierarchical order from largest to smallest grain. Based on the dataset,
# fill in the fields that specify nested spatial grains below.

# ---- EXPLORE AND FORMAT SPECIES DATA ----
#===============================================================================*
# Look at the individual species present and how frequently they occur: This way you can more easily scan the species names (listed alphabetically) and identify potential misspellings, extra characters or blank space, or other issues.

data.frame(table(dataset5$species))

# Uppercase:

dataset5$species = toupper(dataset5$species)

# If there are entries that only specify the genus while there are others that specify the species in addition to that same genus, they need to be regrouped in order to avoid ambiguity. For example, if there are entries of 'Cygnus', 'Cygnus_columbianus', and 'Cygnus_cygnus', 'Cygnus' could refer to either species, but the observer could not identify it. This causes ambiguity in the data, and must be fixed by either 1. deleting the genus-only entry altogether, or 2. renaming the genus-species entries to just the genus-only entry. 
# This decision can be fairly subjective, but generally if less than 25% of the entries are genus-only, then they can be deleted (using bad_sp). If more than 25% of the entries for that genus are only specified to the genus, then the genus-species entries should be renamed to be genus-only (using typo_name). 

table(dataset5$species)

# If species names are coded (not scientific names) go back to study's metadata to learn what species should and shouldn't be in the data. 

# In this example, a quick look at the metadata is not informative, unfortunately. Because of this, you should really stop here and post an issue on GitHub. With some more thorough digging, however, I've found the names represent "Kartez codes". Several species can be removed (double-checked with USDA plant codes at plants.usda.gov and another Sevilleta study (dataset 254) that provides species names for some codes). Some codes were identified with this pdf from White Sands: https://nhnm.unm.edu/sites/default/files/nonsensitive/publications/nhnm/U00MUL02NMUS.pdf

# we then need to 1) figure out what levels of spatial and temporal subsampling
# we should use to characterize that analysis grain, and 2) subset the
# formatted dataset down to that standardized level of subsampling.

# For example, if some sites had 20 spatial subsamples (e.g. quads) per year while
# others had only 16, or 10, we would identify the level of subsampling that 
# at least 'topFractionSites' of sites met (with a default of 50%). We would 
# discard "poorly subsampled" sites (based on this criterion) from further analysis. 
# For the "well-sampled" sites, the function below randomly samples the 
# appropriate number of subsamples for each year or site,
# and bases the characterization of the community in that site-year based on
# the aggregate of those standardized subsamples.
