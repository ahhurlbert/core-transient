#  DATA FORMATTING TEMPLATE
################################################################################*
# Start by opening the data formatting table (data_formatting_table.csv). To determine which dataset you should be working on, see the "format_priority" field. Choose the dataset with the highest format priority, but be sure to check out the format_flag field to see the current status of the dataset.

# Flag codes are as follows:
  # 0 = not currently worked on
  # 1 = formatting complete
  # 2 = formatting in process
  # 3 = formatting halted, issue
  # 4 = data unavailable

# NOTE: All changes to the data formatting table will be done in R! Do not make changes directly to this table, this will create conflicting versions.

# View the structure of the dataset:

str(dataset)

# View first 6 rows of the dataset:

# Here, we can see that there are some fields that we won't use. Let's remove them, note that I've given a new name here "dataset1", this is to ensure that we don't have to go back to square 1 if we've miscoded anything.

# If all fields will be used, then set unusedFields = 9999.

# You also might want to change the names of the identified species field [to 'species'] and/or the identified site field [to 'site']. Just make sure you make specific comments on what the field name was before you made the change, as seen above.

# Explore, if everything looks okay, you're ready to move forward. If not, retrace your steps to look for and fix errors. 

head(dataset1, 10)

# I've found it helpful to explore more than just the first 6 data points given with just a head(), so I used head(dataset#, 10) or even 20 to 50 to get a better snapshot of what the data looks like.  Do this periodically throughout the formatting process

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
# ---- EXPLORE AND FORMAT SITE DATA ----
#===============================================================================*
# From the previous head commmand, we can see that sites are broken up into (potentially) 5 fields. Find the metadata link in the data formatting table use that link to determine how sites are characterized.

#  -- If sampling is nested (e.g., site, block, treatment, plot, quad as in this study), use each of the identifying fields and separate each field with an underscore. For nested samples be sure the order of concatenated columns goes from coarser to finer scales (e.g. "km_m_cm")

# -- If sites are listed as lats and longs, use the finest available grain and separate lat and long fields with an underscore.

# -- If the site definition is clear, make a new site column as necessary.

# -- If the dataset is for just a single site, and there is no site column, then add one.

# Here, we will concatenate all of the potential fields that describe the site 
# in hierarchical order from largest to smallest grain. Based on the dataset,
# fill in the fields that specify nested spatial grains below.

site_grain_names = c("site", "block", "treatment", "plot", "quad")

# We will now create the site field with these codes concatenated if there
# are multiple grain fields. Otherwise, site will just be the single grain field.
num_grains = length(site_grain_names)

site = dataset2[, site_grain_names[1]]
if (num_grains > 1) {
  for (i in 2:num_grains) {

  } 
}


# BEFORE YOU CONTINUE. We need to make sure that there are at least minNTime for sites at the coarsest possilbe spatial grain. 

siteCoarse = dataset2[, site_grain_names[1]]

if (dateformat == '%Y' | dateformat == '%y') {
  dateYear = dataset2$date

ddply(datasetYearTest, .(siteCoarse), summarise, 
      lengthYears =  length(unique(dateYear)))

# If the dataset has less than minNTime years per site, do not continue processing. 


# Do some quality control by comparing the site fields in the dataset with the new vector of sites:

head(site)

# Check how evenly represented all of the sites are in the dataset. If this is the
# type of dataset where every site was sampled on a regular schedule, then you
# expect to see similar values here across sites. Sites that only show up a small
# percent of the time may reflect typos.

data.frame(table(site))

# All looks correct, so replace the site column in the dataset (as a factor) and remove the unnecessary fields, start by renaming the dataset to dataset2:

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
# ---- EXPLORE AND FORMAT COUNT DATA ----

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
# ---- EXPLORE AND FORMAT SPECIES DATA ----
#===============================================================================*
# Here, your primary goal is to ensure that all of your species are valid. To do so, you need to look at the list of unique species very carefully. Avoid being too liberal in interpretation, if you notice an entry that MIGHT be a problem, but you can't say with certainty, create an issue on GitHub.

# Look at the individual species present:

levels(dataset5$species) 

# The first thing that I notice is that there are lower and upper case entries. Because R is case-sensitive, this will be coded as separate species. Modify this prior to continuing:

dataset5$species = factor(toupper(dataset5$species))

# Now explore the listed species themselves, again. A good trick here to finding problematic entries is to shrink the console below horizontally so that species names will appear in a single column.  This way you can more easily scan the species names (listed alphabetically) and identify potential misspellings, extra characters or blank space, or other issues.

levels(dataset5$species)

# If species names are coded (not scientific names) go back to study's metadata to learn what species should and shouldn't be in the data. 

# In this example, a quick look at the metadata is not informative, unfortunately. Because of this, you should really stop here and post an issue on GitHub. With some more thorough digging, however, I've found the names represent "Kartez codes". Several species can be removed (double-checked with USDA plant codes at plants.usda.gov and another Sevilleta study (dataset 254) that provides species names for some codes). Some codes were identified with this pdf from White Sands: https://nhnm.unm.edu/sites/default/files/nonsensitive/publications/nhnm/U00MUL02NMUS.pdf

dataset6 = dataset5[!dataset5$species %in% bad_sp,]

# It may be useful to count the number of times each name occurs, as misspellings or typos will likely
# only show up one time.

table(dataset6$species)

# If you find any potential typos, try to confirm that the "mispelling" isn't actually a valid name.
# If not, then go ahead and replace all instances like this:

# typo_name = ''
# good_name = ''

# dataset6$species[dataset6$species == typo_name] = good_name


# Reset the factor levels:

dataset6$species = factor(dataset6$species)

# Let's look at how the removal of bad species and altered the length of the dataset:
