#  -- If sampling is nested (e.g., site, block, treatment, plot, quad as in this study), use each of the identifying fields and separate each field with an underscore. For nested samples be sure the order of concatenated columns goes from coarser to finer scales (e.g. "km_m_cm")

# -- If sites are listed as lats and longs, use the finest available grain and separate lat and long fields with an underscore.

# -- If the site definition is clear, make a new site column as necessary.

# -- If the dataset is for just a single site, and there is no site column, then add one.

# Here, we will concatenate all of the potential fields that describe the site 
# in hierarchical order from largest to smallest grain:

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
# ---- EXPLORE AND FORMAT SPECIES DATA ----
#===============================================================================*
# Here, your primary goal is to ensure that all of your species are valid. To do so, you need to look at the list of unique species very carefully. Avoid being too liberal in interpretation, if you notice an entry that MIGHT be a problem, but you can't say with certainty, create an issue on GitHub.

# Rename "Species" column to "species"

names(dataset5)[4] = 'species'

# Look at the individual species present:

levels(dataset5$species) 

# The first thing that I notice is that there are lower and upper case entries. Because R is case-sensitive, this will be coded as separate species. Modify this prior to continuing:

dataset5$species = factor(toupper(dataset5$species))

# Now explore the listed species themselves, again. A good trick here to finding problematic entries is to shrink the console below horizontally so that species names will appear in a single column.  This way you can more easily scan the species names (listed alphabetically) and identify potential misspellings, extra characters or blank space, or other issues.

levels(dataset5$species)

# If species names are coded (not scientific names) go back to study's metadata to learn what species should and shouldn't be in the data. 

# In this example, a quick look at the metadata is not informative, unfortunately. Because of this, you should really stop here and post an issue on GitHub. With some more thorough digging, however, I've found the names represent "Kartez codes". Several species can be removed (double-checked with USDA plant codes at plants.usda.gov and another Sevilleta study (dataset 254) that provides species names for some codes). Some codes were identified with this pdf from White Sands: https://nhnm.unm.edu/sites/default/files/nonsensitive/publications/nhnm/U00MUL02NMUS.pdf

bad_sp = c('SOMETHING ELSE')

dataset6 = dataset5[!dataset5$species %in% bad_sp,]

# It may be useful to count the number of times each name occurs, as misspellings or typos will likely
# only show up one time.

table(dataset6$species)

# Reset the factor levels:

dataset6$species = factor(dataset6$species)

# Let's look at how the removal of bad species and altered the length of the dataset:

nrow(dataset5)

nrow(dataset6)

# Look at the head of the dataset to ensure everything is correct:

head(dataset6)

#!DATA FORMATTING TABLE UPDATE!

# Column M. Notes_spFormat. Provide a THOROUGH description of any changes made
# to the species field, including why any species were removed.

dataFormattingTable[,'Notes_spFormat'] =

# ---- MAKE DATA FRAME OF COUNT BY SITES, SPECIES, AND YEAR ----
#===============================================================================*
# Now we will make the final formatted dataset, add a datasetID field, check for errors, and remove records that cant be used for our purposes.
