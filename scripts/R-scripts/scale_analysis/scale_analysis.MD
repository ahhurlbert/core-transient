# Notes on exploring the impacts of spatial scale on temporal occupancy

* Finish or approach finishing comparison analysis: 

* Finish multi-scale iterations of geographic and environmental distance site pairings. 

* Run models comparing discrepancies at different scales. 

* Does scale of sample play a role in explaining discrepancies between sites? 
 
	- Run variation partitioning analysis for each scale. 

	- Compare outcomes. 


2 pieces: 

1) independent of breeding bird census stuff * how do these patterns vary with scale, period, independent of bbs and bbc? 

* for just bbs 

* shift in temporal occupancy from transient to core 

	- how does that shift happen and what impacts it? 

* geographic context within a site sits: landscape heterogeneity, ndvi 

	- we already know bbs routes in more hetero vs homog at same scale has more transient spp 

* scale patterns: could be that we expect mean occupancy to increase with higher spatial scales 

* how do these patterns differ between homo and hetero landscapes as scale increases? 

	- might include diffs in slope and leveling off between two curves 

	- as we change scale in a more hetero region or route, how does temp occupancy vary? 

	- at the scale of a bbs route and below (sets of 10 or below) 

* can extract temporal occupancy values for every spp 

	- most immediate piece to work on first

2) Bigger picture comparisons I wrote above 


Make changes, commit to the repo, every time I make changes commit to git 
MD files are markdown files - descriptive notes 

create a markdown file for the R-scripts scale analysis folder  

update markdown file 2x every week, treat like a lab notebook that I *have* to keep

2 sep functions for 10 pt count and then for 50 stop data 



2) 


May: 

* ~~next week: work on making function run~~ 

June: 

* ~~week 1: fix softcoding within a function issue~~
 
* ~~week 2: occ_counts function fixed~~

* ~~week 3: tentative groupings assembled~~

* ~~week 4: groupings trashed in lieu of generating "Stop_" sequence by forloop~~


July: 

* ~~week 1: forloop construction and troubleshooting~~ 

* ~~week 2: forloop and sequences finalized~~  

* ~~week 3: Calculate occupancy for scale clusters based on presence/absence at each stop~~ 

* ~~week 4: Calculate relationship between scale and occupancy in BBS data alone~~


August: 

* week 1: Preliminarily test out BBC-BBS pairings at multiple scales; geog + env distance analyses. Test for occupancy vs habitat heterogeneity at multiple scales. Wrap up.

* week 2: Away. 

* week 3: Clean up code, add graphs. August-Sept plan for return to Fall semester.
