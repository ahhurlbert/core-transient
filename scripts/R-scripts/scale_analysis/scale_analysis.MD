2 components: 

1) independent of breeding bird census analyses * how do occupancy patterns in BBS vary with scale? 

* for just bbs 

* shift in temporal occupancy from transient to core 

	- how does that shift happen and what impacts it? 

* geographic context within a site sits: landscape heterogeneity, ndvi 

	- we already know bbs routes in more hetero vs homog at same scale has more transient spp 

* scale patterns: could be that we expect mean occupancy to increase with higher spatial scales 

* how do these patterns differ between homo and hetero landscapes as scale increases? 

	- might include diffs in slope and leveling off between two curves 

	- as we change scale in a more hetero region or route, how does temp occupancy vary? 

	- at the scale of a bbs route and below (sets of 10 or below) 

* can extract temporal occupancy values for every spp 

	- most immediate piece to work on first

2) Compare BBS occupancy with BBC observer-defined occupancy categories 
* pair BBS and BBC sites by geographic distance 
	
	-compare category agreements and discrepancies 
	
	-run for multiple scales: 
		
		-at single-route-site paired scale
		
		-at scales beneath a single BBS route, encompassing different segment lengths w/in a given route 
			
			-because BBC sites are often irregular in size and smaller than a single BBS route, may be closer to a single segment of a route than the entire route itself 
	
* pair BBS and BBC sites by distance in environmental space (i.e. axes are environmental variables: NDVI, elevation, precip, etc.) 

	-compare category agreements and discrepancies
	
	-run for multiple scales: 
		
		-at single-route-site paired scale
		
		-at scales beneath a single BBS route, encompassing different segment lengths w/in a given route 
			
			-because BBC sites are often irregular in size and smaller than a single BBS route, may be more environmentally similar to a single segment of a route than the entire route itself 


# Notes on exploring the impacts of spatial scale on temporal occupancy

* Run models comparing discrepancies at different scales. 

* Does scale of sample play a role in explaining discrepancies between sites? 
 
	- Run variation partitioning analysis for each scale. 

	- Compare outcomes.
