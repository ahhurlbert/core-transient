# Description of each R-script in folder

### BBS_manipulation for summary
Script for formatting BBS data to use in all analyses.
### bbs_ndvi_richness_correlation
Script acquiring the gimms ndvi data and to verify the NDVI-richness correlation in the breeding bird survey.
### bimod_metric_simulations
Script to simulate the beta distributions that differ in bimodality to test H-W bimodality function.
### core-transient_functions
Script for all relevant functions used in analyses, most scripts will source this code.
### core-transient-figure-2
Script used to create Figure 2 in manuscript.
### core-transient-figure-3
Script used to create Figure 3 and Figure S2 in manuscript.
### core-transient-figure-4
Script used to create Figure 4 in manuscript.
### core-transient-figure-5
Script used to create Figure 5 in manuscript.
### core-transient-figure-S4
Script used to create Figures S3 & S4 in manuscript.
### core-transient-figure-S5

### maxgrain
Script to calculate the maximum grain of analysis for each scaled dataset.
### null_models
Script to run the null models and create figures discussed in Appendix 2.
### running_cleaning_scripts
Script to run all data cleaning scripts with one for loop.
### scale_analysis_CT
Script to calculate the number of spatial grains used in each dataset and created each dataset at the 33%, 25%, and 10% transient thresholds.
### temporal_turnover
Script to calculate turnover and turnover with the bray-curtis index for all datasets. The datasets created in this script are used in core-transient-figure-5 and core-transient-figure-5S to create Figures 5C, S5, S6, and S7.
