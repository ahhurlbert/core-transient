# Core-transient
Data and code for NSF funded research on core vs transient species

## Description of each R-script in folder.

BBS_manipulation for summary: code for formatting BBS data to use in all analyses.
bbs_ndvi_richness_correlation: code for how the gimms ndvi data was acquired. Code also used to verify the NDVI-richness correlation in the breeding bird survey.
bimod_metric_simulations: Code to simulate the beta distributions that differ in bimodality to test H-W bimodality function.
core-transient_functions: Code for all relevant functions used in analyses, most scripts will source this code.
core-transient-figure-2: Code used to create Figure 2 in manuscript.
core-transient-figure-3: Code used to create Figure 3 and Figure S2 in manuscript.
core-transient-figure-4: Code used to create Figure 4 in manuscript.
core-transient-figure-5: Code used to create Figure 5 in manuscript.
core-transient-figure-S4: Code used to create Figures S3 & S4 in manuscript.
core-transient-figure-S5: Code used to create Figures S5 & S6 in manuscript.
maxgrain: Code to calculate the maximum grain of analysis for each scaled dataset.
null_models: Code to run the null models and create figures discussed in Appendix 2.
running_cleaning_scripts: Code to run all data cleaning scripts with one for loop.
scale_analysis_CT: Code to calculate the number of spatial grains used in each dataset and created each dataset at the 33%, 25%, and 10% transient thresholds.
temporal_turnover: Code to calculate turnover and turnover with the bray-curtis index for all datasets. The datasets created in this script are used in core-transient-figure-5 and core-transient-figure-5S to create Figures 5C, S5, S6, and S7.
