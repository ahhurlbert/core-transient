=======================

datasets for core-transient species analyses

Decision rules when lumping data from multiple surveys at a given location (e.g., monthly surveys linked by season)

- Choose appropriate time scale for lumping.
- Include lumping decision (temporal analysis grain) in the metadata document
- Select the maximum number of individuals per count to avoid double-counting individuals within a sampling period
-- Note: Especially a concern when there are recaptures (e.g., Sevilleta mammals and Portal)
