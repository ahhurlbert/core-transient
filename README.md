# Core-transient
Data and code for NSF funded research on core vs transient species


## Priority rankings for obtaining and/or formatting data, on a scale of 0-3, are currently based on summing:

### 0 = Low priority
Common system and taxa, less than 20 sites **OR** sites defined by Lat Long

### 1 = Minor priority
Common system and taxa, more than 20 sites (**IF** sites are not defined by Lat Long)
-OR- uncommon system OR taxa less than 20 sites (**OR** sites defined by Lat Long)

### 2 = Medium priority
Uncommon system OR taxa, more than 20 sites (**IF** sites are not defined by Lat Long)
-OR- uncommon system AND taxa, less than 20 sites (**OR** sites defined by Lat Long)

### 3 = high priority
Uncommon system AND taxa, more than 20 sites (**IF** sites are not defined by Lat Long)

#### Uncommon taxa (based on current representation in formatted datasets)
Arthropod, Invertebrate, Plankton, Mammal  
  
#### Uncommon System (based on current representation in formatted datasets)
Terrestrial or Aquatic
