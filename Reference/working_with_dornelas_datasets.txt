# The datasets from Dornelas are those with a dataset ID of <201! 

# Notes for using datasets from Dornelas:

Many samples do not include our minimum sample size of 5 years, including:

ID= 10,73,74,77,96,98,122,142,186,199,201,202

For points from eco archives and LTER sites with publicly available data I should use retriever, including: 

ID=18,44,45,54,56,57,58,59,194

Additionally, there is good access to Smithsonian TRI data, and this should be gathered via the retriever:

ID=20,201,202

I believe we already have the Patuxent data: ID = 195

Removed samples with < 10 observations, includes:

ID = 52, 51, 53,63, 81, 192

Temporal extent mislabelled for ID = 75. A 4 year study, listed as 5. Removed.
