data_obtained,factor,describes whether datasets have been downloaded and placed in the raw_datasets folder
data_formatted,factor,describes whether datasets have been reduced to the necessary columns
obtain_priority,numeric,"priority is valued between 0-5 and is based on current representation of the system (terrestrial, aquatic, marine) and taxa as well as the number of years and sites in the study"
format_priority,numeric,"0 = Low priority: common system and taxa, less than 20 sites; 1 = Minor priority: common system and taxa, more than 20 sites -OR- uncommon system OR taxa less than 20 sites; 2 = Medium priority: Uncommon system OR taxa, more than 20 sites -OR- uncommon system AND taxa, less than 20 sites; 3 = high priority: Uncommon system AND taxa, more than 20 sites  "
flag_code,numeric,"0 = not currently worked on, 1 = formatting complete, 2 = formatting in process, 3 = formatting halted, issue "
spatial_sites,factor,Y or N. Whether sites are determined by lat and lon
dataset_name,character,Name provided for the dataset

taxa,character,The taxonomic group being studied (e.g. plankton or birds)
organism,character,Sub-class of the taxonomic group if a more specific grouping is available.
location,character,"Describes the spatial location of the data (e.g., Channel Islands, CA)"
CentralLatitude,numeric,"The mean latitude of the samples – if lat lon data are not available, this may be estimated from the spatial location of the sampling location (e.g., Channel Islands)"
CentralLongitude,numeric,The mean longitude of the samples
LatLon_FLAG,numeric,"0 or 1; 0 = central lat and lon derived from provided lat lons associated with sites, 1 = central lat and lon estimated from the sampling location"

spatial_exent_units,character,Units of extent
spatial_scale_variable,character,Y or N. Whether or not the dataset can be used to explore the effects of spatial scaling on core-transient designation.
count_type,factor,"Density, cover, or count."
nRecs,numeric,The number of records in the formatted dataset
nSites,numeric,The number of sites in the formatted dataset
nTime,numeric,"The number of time samples in the formatted dataset (if this varies by site, it will be the maximum number of time samples)"
