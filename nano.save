# Notes from meeting on 10/9 with Ethan and Allen

# We've switched from https to ssh. See help on github for generating ssh keys (was thankfully easy on Mint!)

# Added submodule "data" which contains the core-transient datasets folder.

## ---- Make sure to use the following commands to work with the submodule on a new machine:

git submodule init
git submodule update

## From now on, work with data within the submodule rather than the core-transient-datasets folder

## ---- add-commit-pull will now have an additional step, once per day you have to commit and push the submodule:

git add data
git commit -m "daily update of the data file"

## Note : this allows the changes to be known across machines.
