Dear Dr. Shapiro,

I am a graduate student at the University of North Carolina. I am working with Drs. Allen Hurlbert and Ethan White on a research project that explores the influence of differences between core and transient species on species richness modeling across taxa and ecosystems (the original paper behind this idea is attached). To do so, we are compiling as many community time series datasets as possible. Your 34 year dataset of butterfly communities would make a great addition to our study and we were wondering if you would be willing to let us work with it for this project.

Dataset info (but not the datasets themselves) are being compiled at ecologicaldata.org. At the author's discression, datasets that authors wish to make publicly available will be downloadable via the EcoData Retriever (ecodataretriever.org, for more information see http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0065848). We view this as a major service to the macroecology community!
 

Thank you for any help you can provide,
