Notes from meeting with Allen re core-transient on 7/15/2014

Overall purpose: To lay out short term goals for the coming few weeks and determine how to deal with some problems in datasets.

Goal: Start working on the beginnings of the analysis script. Use 3-4 datasets that pose diverse "problems" in doing so. Try to make the process as generalizeable as possible and get the work flow for the analysis down.

Goal: In the data_source_table, possibly create a column that describes whether a data set needs to be re-organized or cleaned before it can be run. As most datasets likely need some sort of re-organization, this column may be unnecessary.

Goal: Create a folder of R-scripts that are used for re-organizing or cleaning data. This process should be automated and be as generalizable as possible (i.e., try to write scripts that can be used for as many datasets as possible). Also create a script that hunts for mispellings.

Goal[ignore for now]: We will need to clean the taxonomic names. The R package taxize may be useful for this.

Goal: Spatial grain should be a quantitative column rather than categorical. Categorical descriptions of the spatial grain (and extent) can be derived from this value.

Goal: Create a folder in the core-transient-datasets git where data papers associated with the datasets are stored.

Goal: Add columns to the data_source_table that describe whether a dataset is suitable for goals 2 and 3 of the project
	2: Sites must contain latlongs and have >= 10 sites (currently, the latter may change).
	3: Sites must be able to be nested at larger spatial scales.

General notes:
-Because of siteID and x,y coordinate problems, we will wait until late August for the Dornelas data, taking her up on her offer to run the queries for us.

-Aggregating spatial and temporal data may be an issue (i.e., choosing the appropriate scales by which to aggregate). We will cross this bridge later.
