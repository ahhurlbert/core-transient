## Meeting notes: Meeting with Allen, 10/2/14

* make ~30 commits per day, each commit should contain only one chunk of information (i.e. refer to a change in only one file)
* make use of bioark because itâ€™s backed up every night!
* email Maria re having her assistant query the data
* Post issues to self as a to-do list
* add and modify code from Coyle et al. (week 2)
* continue to clean and format data files (week 1)
* What the heck are submodules and can they be used to avoid the setwd problem?
* Remove setwd from scripts
* We need to come up with a way to prioritize dataset so that we are ensuring that we get an adequate grab of taxa and regions in the preliminary analyses.
* For d228, add a comment in the script that says that each text file is representative of one of 4 hubbard brook sites

## Meeting on 10/9 with Ethan and Allen
* We've switched from https to ssh. See help on github for generating ssh keys (was thankfully easy on Mint!)
### Working with the submodule
* Added submodule "data" which contains the core-transient datasets folder.
* Make sure to use the following commands to work with the submodule on a new machine:
  * git submodule init
  * git submodule update
* From now on, work with data within the submodule rather than the core-transient-datasets folder
* ---- add-commit-pull will now have an additional step, once per day you have to commit and push the submodule:
git add data
git commit -m "daily update of the data file"
_**Note:** this allows the changes to be known across machines_
