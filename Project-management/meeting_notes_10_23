Meeting notes, Ethan and Allen 10/23

Bimodality:
Function needs to be modified, for max 1 represented 1/2 the time and minimum possible = 1/# of years sampled.
Conduct a statistical test for bimodality, potentially look into the clustering world for this (see Tokeshi 1992 and Silverman 1981 papers for another option).
Also search into Gaussian mixture modeling (though this approach may have limitations)

Also look into including fitted beta parameters as a next step

Site subsets:
Ensure that there is at least 5 samples (temporally) per site. Those that do not have this should be discarded.

Plots:
Include the length of the time series in the title
Set bins such that each bin covers a 1/t block, # of bins should be # of years - 1 (?)
Top bar shouldn't be 1 or greater, rather ensure that the top bar ends at 1

Distribution of work:

4 categories at this point
a) Adding datasets
b) Cleaning datasets for analysis (for a and b prioritize to maximize the # of sites per dataset)
c) Continue work on data summary script
d) Work towards the inclusion of environmental variables (hold off on this for now though)

Site table:
Include biome ... to do this, probably a gis extraction based on point data for each site.

Environment:
There will have to be some sort of "if" statement for extracting data, as marine and terrestrial will have different data needs
Look into MODIS package (Allen sent email regarding this).
We will cover thinking through environmental datasets during our next meeting (10/30)
